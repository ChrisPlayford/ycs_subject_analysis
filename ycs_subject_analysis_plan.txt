Actions:
1) Download YCS1-YCS13
2) Prepare YCS5-YCS10 first
3) Then decide - either YCS1-4 (older but harmonised) or YCS11-13 (newer but not harmonised)

* 15th December 2016

* YCS6 is mostly done
* Need to go back to YCS6 and check t0examaf t0examac t0score with ew_core values
* YCS6 t0examst is fine (based this on what learnt from YCS10)

* YCS10 is missing the serial variable. Have emailed UKDS + Vernon + Roxanne
* YCS10 do-file is about 50% complete.

* Going to work on YCS5 next

* 19th December 2016

* Have emailed NatCen about the missing serial number on YCS10
* Investigated a multi-variable match but cannot get unique combination yet

* Corrected an error in coding subjects (mistakenly coded some subjects as 4 Geography, should be 14 Other Languages).



* YCS 5-9 complete but would like to do some more checking.
* Need to set up the common file paths in the files to make things tidier.


Further investigations of the SN5765 User Guide suggest that it is not worth analysing prior to YCS5 because of lack of detailed information on parental occupation:

p.50 "Detailed code describing father’s/mother’s occupation, using 1991 SOC6. SOC is not available for E& W cohorts prior to 1990."

     "Parents’ occupation in YCS1 was not coded in sufficient detail to allow recoding to SOC. Parents’ occupation was not asked at YCS3 sweep1."

p.51 "It has not been possible to derive SEC for E&W cohorts in 1984-1988 which did not have detailed occupation coding."


In addition, information on whether parents had A-levels or a degree was not present before 1990.
