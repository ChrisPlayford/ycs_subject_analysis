Actions:
1) Download YCS1-YCS13
2) Prepare YCS5-YCS10 first
3) Then decide - either YCS1-4 (older but harmonised) or YCS11-13 (newer but not harmonised)

***

* 15th December 2016

* YCS6 is mostly done
* Need to go back to YCS6 and check t0examaf t0examac t0score with ew_core values
* YCS6 t0examst is fine (based this on what learnt from YCS10)

* YCS10 is missing the serial variable. Have emailed UKDS + Vernon + Roxanne
* YCS10 do-file is about 50% complete.

* Going to work on YCS5 next

***

* 19th December 2016

* Have emailed NatCen about the missing serial number on YCS10
* Investigated a multi-variable match but cannot get unique combination yet

* Corrected an error in coding subjects (mistakenly coded some subjects as 4 Geography, should be 14 Other Languages).

* YCS 5-9 complete but would like to do some more checking.
* Need to set up the common file paths in the files to make things tidier.


Further investigations of the SN5765 User Guide suggest that it is not worth analysing prior to YCS5 because of lack of detailed information on parental occupation:

p.50 "Detailed code describing father’s/mother’s occupation, using 1991 SOC6. SOC is not available for E& W cohorts prior to 1990."

     "Parents’ occupation in YCS1 was not coded in sufficient detail to allow recoding to SOC. Parents’ occupation was not asked at YCS3 sweep1."

p.51 "It has not been possible to derive SEC for E&W cohorts in 1984-1988 which did not have detailed occupation coding."


In addition, information on whether parents had A-levels or a degree was not present before 1990.

* Added YCS11

YCS12 & YCS13 Lack of variables explanation - Information on lack of GCSE subject variables in YCS12 and YCS13.

See 'ycs12_ycs13_no_subject_info_20161220_cp_v1.docx'

* Afternoon of 20th December

Went through some code harmonising YCS10 and YCS11 with SN5765
Wrote some new code checking my YCS10 codings with SN5765

Mostly pretty consistent but some issues around SOC90 and SOC2000. Croxford et al. have done quite a bit of work converting between these.
YCS10 appears to have SOC2000 information but the codes have been removed from the variable. Very annoying.
It would be a lot easier if the serial number was available...

21st December 2016

Planning the next steps:

* 3_ycs6_background_vars.do 	- This file harmonises YCS6 with ew_core.dta (SN5765). It has previously been checked through harmonisation work done using YCS5 (for verification).

* 3_ycs10_background_vars.do 	- I use 3_ycs10_background_vars_check.do to check this
				- I need to go through this again. It is mostly OK, a few missing/-9 codes to change to harmonise with ew_core.dta (SN5765)
				- I will need to either translate SOC2000 codes into SOC90 or go straight from SOC2000 to NS-SEC.

* 3_ycs11_background_vars.do	- This will need minor modifications based on the checking exercise and SOC2000 work done in 3_ycs10_background_vars.do

**

* The following files need looking over for consistency of variable position (i.e. varying number of standard subjects and additional subjects). I would like it to be consistent.

*  2_ycs5_gsce_subjects
*  2_ycs6_gsce_subjects
*  2_ycs7_gsce_subjects
*  2_ycs8_gsce_subjects
*  2_ycs9_gsce_subjects
* 2_ycs10_gsce_subjects
* 2_ycs11_gsce_subjects

**

* Merging plan

* Create ID variable for subjects datasets 	- Croxford et al. 'Note: the full key for linkage is t0cohort, t0nation, t0caseid'
						- We don't link to Scottish data so t0cohort, t0caseid should be sufficient

* Prepare ew_core.dta				- Drop pre-1990s data
						- Drop YCS10 from records (because of lack of serial number)
						- keep only variables of interest

* Merge subjects datasets to prepared ew_core.dta for YCS5-9 using t0cohort & t0caseid

* Create ID variable for YCS10 based on _n in dataset.
* Merge YCS10 background variables with subject dataset.
* Append this to prepared ew_core.dta

* Merge YCS11 background variables with subject dataset.
* Append this to prepared ew_core.dta

* Download appropriate files for SOC90/SOC2000 lookup from CAMSIS website (depending on decision made during previous preparation).

* Use t0dadsoc and t0mumsoc variables + employment statuses in extended ew_core.data to produce parental stratification measures by merging with CAMSIS website lookups.

* The extended ew_core.dta file should now have subject and background information for YCS5-11.

* Revisit the plan at this point. 
* The steps after this relate to preparing the explanatory variables for model fitting.
* Then fit some latent class models.

6th January 2017

Quite a lot of minor changes this morning and yesterday afternoon

* Recoded the SOC2000 information with the appropriate codes for YCS10
* Created a new ID variable for YCS10 datasets (background_vars and gcse_subjects) to enable merging
* Added some extra file paths
* Checked through YCS10 and YCS11 background variables
* Created a couple of files inspecting the contents of the datasets by creating an Excel spreadsheet
	* '4_inspection_background_vars_datasets.do'
	* '4_inspection_gcse_subjects_datasets.do'

This afternoon I have worked on checking for consistency, appending and merging the datasets. Some minor labelling errors have been corrected.

On Monday I need to go back and sort out the issue with integer raw variables (see end of '4_ycs5_11_append_merge.do') using the decode command. 

***

9th January 2017

* Cleaned up issue with numeric raw subject grade variables in YCS10 and YCS11. These were string variables for all other YCS cohorts. Used decode command in '2_ycs10_gsce_subjects' & '2_ycs11_gsce_subjects'.

* Corrected mistaken omission of t0examst, t0examac, t0examaf and t0score from YCS5, YCS7, YCS8 & YCS9.

* Ordered variables and created two datasets:
	* 'ycs5_to_11_set1.dta' contains all variables
	* 'ycs5_to_11_set2.dta' is a subset of variables

* If we change our mind, we can return to this.

* Contemplating that I might want to record the highest score (not just highest A*-C) in 18 main subjects.

UPDATE 1515: I have added the highest score variables alongside the highest A*-C grades in the 18 main subjects

NEXT STEPS:

* Download appropriate files for SOC90/SOC2000 lookup from CAMSIS website (depending on decision made during previous preparation).
* Use t0dadsoc and t0mumsoc variables + employment statuses in extended ew_core.data to produce parental stratification measures by merging with CAMSIS website lookups.
* The extended ew_core.dta file should now have subject and background information for YCS5-11.

***

10th January 2017

* I have added variables from the CAMSIS website: NS-SEC, RGSC & CAMSIS.

NEXT STEPS:

* Exploratory analyses of GCSE subjects variables
* Potential recoded variables summarising GCSE subjects variables
* Prepare dummy codings for predictive models

Analytical decisions (for the record):

* Kept 'U' grade in A*-C/A*-F measures (t0examac & t0examaf) for consistency with t0score where a 'U' is awarded zero points. We can change this if we want to.
* The classification of subjects into 18 main subject groupings is done through recodes in the subjects do-files. There may be minor debates around the exact classification of a subject to a grouping.
* The subjects classification includes IT as "12 Other Science" - on the basis that Computer Science is classified as a Science.
* I have coded employment status as 7 "employees" rather than 0 "missing". If I do not do this, the number of missing cases is huge (approx 80% of the dataset).
* Employment status is coded as 2 "self-employed with fewer than 25 employees" when a parent is flagged as being self-employed. No other information is available.

* UPDATE 1630:

* I have added two files:
	* 4_ycs5_11_recoding_preparation.do
	* 5_ycs5_11_analysis1_exploration.do

* These initial investigations suggest a very consistent 4 class model when using the same specification as per YCS6.
* I am contemplating whether my do-files from the SLS analysis would be useful (would need to request or get from Ladywell House).

NEXT STEPS:

* Further investigation of different subject-grouping categorisation

***

19th January 2017

* I have explored the number of latent class using both the same and an alternative subject grouping to YCS6.
* 4 Class models fit the best in both cases once the samples are reduced to the working set (complete cases on independent variables).
* I have defined these samples in the dataset
* I have merged the assigned classes with the main dataset
* I have fitted an initial multinomial logistic regression model to the modal latent class assignment
* The results are very consistent with previous work using YCS6

NEXT STEPS:

* Harmomise the order of the latent classes
* Speak with Vernon about format of dataset and preliminary results (may produce some outputs to demonstrate this).

***

24th January 2017

* I have harmonised the order of the latent classes and looked at some descriptive statistics + initial models

NEXT STEPS:

* Produce some outputs - can form basis of talk.
* Speak with Vernon about format of dataset and preliminary results.

***

1st February 2017

* Returning to this - decided to replicate the tables and figures in the Youth Studies paper
* Added some derived variables summarising GCSE attainment to '4_ycs5_11_recoding_preparation.do'

Comments:

* I have come to the conclusion that the inclusion of U grades doesn't matter in t0examaf and t0examac
* This is because t0examaf and t0examac are summary variables and only count the number of passes for grades higher than G or D respectively
* U or G counts as 0 in both instances
* U does not contribute to the missing cases (i.e. non-missing) which is correct
* Therefore comparison of t0examaf, t0examac and t0score in SN5765 with my results will yield the same figures.

***

2nd February 2017

* Continued replication of the tables and figures in the Youth Studies paper
* Minor changes to derived variables

***

3rd February

* Continued replication of the tables and figures in the Youth Studies paper
* Some minor changes (mvdecode on t0examst)

NEXT STEPS:

* mlogit of latent classes
* Proportional assignment
